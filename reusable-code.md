# Lies, Damned Lies and Reusable Code

So, this whole thing about reusable code is mostly a sham, right?

Obviously there *are* cases where code *is* being reused, I'm not denying
that. But if code was really truly reusable, in the deep meaning that
OOP textbooks seem to indicate when they use the word, then all of us
nice programmers would be out of a job.

Not entirely true, since the Moore's law ensures that the hardware platform
is always mutating below us (though that looks like it might be coming to
and end as we are starting to hit some real physical limitations, like not
wanting a phone that burns through your thigh, but who knows. If I had
wanted to deal with real world objects and their disgusting fleshy
materiality, I obviously wouldn't have become a programmer. Now back to our
regular programming: building virtual sand castles out of imagination sand.
But I digress. No really?)

And also, I guess, we might have to add some code to this perfect
reusable code base whenever some truly new thing is discovered. Like when
they confirmed the existence of the Higg's boson. We would have to add
a couple of lines of code for *that*.

But all in all there sure would be a hell of a lot fewer of us.
