# 800 Spiders on the PS3

* Separate problems of path finding and local navigation
* Local navigation:
	- Find desired direction
	- RVO
		- Cannot run on all (n2)
		- Find "nearby" agents
		- Run RVO on them
		
* Nearby agents
	- Grid broadphase
	- Not represent any actual physical structure
	
* RVO
	- Rather expensive
	- Any faster way?
