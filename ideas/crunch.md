# Crunch

I don't think that we should just accept the status quo of what the game industry "is like".

I think that everybody in this industry has a responsibility, not only to make great games, but also to make great workplaces.

This means workplaces that are not heterosexual "boys' clubs", but open and welcoming to all.

This also means showing respect for people's time, recongizing and valueing the fact that they have a life outside of work. 

I find the concept of "crunch" offensive. Sure, overtime can sometimes be necessarily and if you request it with respect and compensate it fairly there is no big harm. But to keep people in a semi-perpetual state of mandatory overtime, that is brutal. That is wrecking lives. And to what end? 60+ hour work weeks quickly lead to diminishing returns. Crunch is the mind-killer.

By not accepting bad work practices you are not only standing up for yourself, you are also making the game development world a better place.
